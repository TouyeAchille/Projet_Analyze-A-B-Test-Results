# Analyze A/B Test Results

The projet Analyze A/B Test Results was completed as part of Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002"> Data Analyst Nanodegree </a> certification.

## Projet details  
A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results in order to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage, 
- Keep the old webpage, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Results
There was no sufficient evidence found to suggest that the new page converts better than the old one.

## Statistical Analysis Scope :
- Bootstrapping sampling distributions
